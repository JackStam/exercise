Launch API
------------
Note: I am not experienced in API and this one I could not test it. 
For the main program the JSON Data, were imported manually to build it.

Note2: The API section has the basic concepts of an API, but probably it
is not working as I have an issue with Flask installation 

Note3: For the problem section, you can run: main(), as it is a wrap-up function. Ouput: Json data

1. Run the api function with the url as param
2. Check if error in the request
3. route is defined as '/productionplan'
4. If no error in the request, data will get extracted  
5. the main function will run and analyze the data and return the result
